<!-- 
    The home.ejs file lists out the content found on 
    the first page of the Team Aptiv web application.
    The EJS file contains two partials: The header
    and the footer. The home page contains a bootstrap
    carousel with different pictures. A navbar is 
    displayed on the top of the page in the header
    through the header partial file, which contains
    the navbar and all of its links. A simple title
    reading "Connecting You with Your Community" is
    present on the screen. Below that title, a simple
    button is listed to bring the user to the events
    page when it is clicked.
