1. What are status report and user management for? 

Answer (Andrew): 
They are special features that are given to the admin user.
The admin user can view summary reports from the database such as total donations
made for all programs and events. User management is also a special feature that
only the admin can use. It enables the admin to delete a user account, create a user
account, and view all of the users of the web app (for most account creations, we 
will have a new user register). What remains to be determined is whether these 
features will be created as new pages or if they will be implemented in a different
way.
